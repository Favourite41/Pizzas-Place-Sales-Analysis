 Pizza Place Sales Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Pizza Place Sales dataset, which provides a year’s worth of transactional data from a fictitious pizza restaurant. The dataset includes details about orders, pizza types, sizes, prices, quantities, and ingredients.
The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and menu effectiveness using Python (pandas, matplotlib)
